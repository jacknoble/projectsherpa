Thanks for checking out Projectsherpa on github. Projectsherpa is a light-weight clone of the collaborative project-management application [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/). I made mine in a week and a half so there are still a lot of features I'm looking forward to adding. But I'm pretty proud of what is there now.

Like the real Basecamp, Projectsherpa runs on Rails. But it differs in that the front-end is a single-page application built with Backbone.js. 

*Features*

Make sure to save yourself some time and user the "Demo User" button on the login page. This takes you to your profile page where you can see your profile photo and those of your employees. Of course, right now the Demo User has my photo, but you can change it by just dragging and dropping a photo of your own right on top of it. Or click beneath it to upload something from your computer. 

Below your photo are your existing projects and a button for creating a new one. You can type in the name of your fellow employees to assign them to the project. Or you can drag their photo and name from the right into the form input. If you forget to assign an employee on project creation, you can assign them later on by dragging their photo to the project square on your profile page.

Creating a new project or clicking on an existing project will bring you to the project's page. Here there are four tabs: todo lists, discussions, documents and delete.

Under todo lists you can add new list and add new todos to those lists. Both can be edited inline just by clicking on them. Todos can be assigned and given a deadline. If you give them a due date and assign them to the demo user ("Jack Noble") you'll be able to see and reschedule them on the Demo User's calendar page. 

Each to todo also has it's own discussion which you can view by clicking the link "# comments".

The discussion page is just what it sounds like, you can create a new discussion and then view and participate in them by clicking on the link.

The documents page lets you store documents relevant to your project. You can add one with drag and drop or by clicking the square on the left. Right now it supports images and pdfs. If you click the discussions for a document ("# comments")
you'll be able to see a full view of the image or pdf and comment as before.

*On their way*

My immediate plans are to add and "updates" tab that will alert users to recent changes to the project and to make todos sortable and draggable between lists.
